[I] About
----------
Automated Redump 2 IRD, or AR2I is The Original Automated IRD Builder.

Automated Redump 2 IRD can perform the following tasks:  
- (Build IRDs) will build all the IRDs for all the ISO files and Zipped ISO files in a directory recursively, using hash information from an SQLite DB.
  
IRDs cannot be built for ROMs with nonmatching titles. Please use a ROM manager to rename your ROMs to match the correct title in the DB.

[II] Requirements
------------------
This app does not ship with the following necessary IsoTools Libraries, which are distributed with IsoTools.
- DiscUtils.dll
- Ionic.Zip.dll
- IsoTools.Common.dll
- Microsoft.CompilerServices.AsyncTargetingPack.Net4.dll

Place these libraries in the program folder with the AutomatedRedump2IRD.exe file.

IsoTools appears to have been discontinued. We do not know where to find the necessary libraries.

[III] Installation
-----------------
Download and unzip the program to any new location that you wish to use. However, this software should be installed as close to the drive's root directory as possible.

Place the IsoTools libraries into the program folder with the AutomatedRedump2IRD.exe file.

I like to put my installation in a directory called AR2I on my C:\ drive. My installation layout looks like this:

C:\AR2I\DB\
C:\AR2I\IRDs\
C:\AR2I\Logs\
C:\AR2I\ROMs\
C:\AR2I\Tmp\
C:\AR2I\AutomatedRedump2IRD.exe
C:\AR2I\DiscUtils.dll
C:\AR2I\Ionic.Zip.dll
C:\AR2I\IsoTools.Common.dll
C:\AR2I\Microsoft.CompilerServices.AsyncTargetingPack.Net4.dll

[IV] How to Build IRDs
--------------------------------
- If you have an account at The Ultimate IRD Database http://tuid.mygamesonline.org, set your username and password by editing the Options from the GUI. This will allow you to send IRDs to the database.
- Rename your ROMs using a ROM manager to match the Redump SQLite DB you are using.
- Place your Redump SQLite DB file in the DB directory, or set the path to it.
- Set the other paths and options as needed.
- Click one of the Build IRDs buttons.

[V] FAQ
---------
Q1) I didn't read or follow the instructions in the help file and I can't get this software to work properly. Can you help?
A1) No.

Q2) Why do I keep getting errors about path and file lengths?
A2) Obviously, you chose an installation path that is too long. This won't happen if you follow the installation instructions. Please read the Installation Section again and this time follow the instructions.

Q3) I appear to be blocked from some or all databases, or appear to be blocked from using this software. What gives?
A3) There are way too many reasons why this may or may not be happening. One example might be that you are using a blacklisted or abusive host, which may be blocked by some networks. In many cases, the network filtering may also be completely out of anyone's control.

Q4) Why can't this software find matches based on ROM hashes? My ROMs are not named according to the Redump datafile that corresponds to the matching SQLite DB.
A4) This software is designed to be used specifically for the Redump database. Finding matches using this info takes a fraction of a second. Finding matches based on hash values could take many days to find a SINGLE match and build a SINGLE IRD. Using hash values to find matches would defy all common sense.
